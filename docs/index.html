            <h2>About The Project</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the showcase of our 3D localization and visualization system. This project aims to provide real-time tracking and environmental awareness for emergency responders. Below is the story of how this system came to life, from the first lines of code to a fully functional 3D interface.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="phase1">
            <h2>Phase 1: The Foundation</h2>
            <p>Every great project starts with a blank canvas. Our first build was humble—a simple 3D view populated with randomly spaced balls to establish our coordinate system and test the basic rendering engine.</p>
            <div class="gallery-item">

        </section>

        <section id="phase2">
            <h2>Phase 2: Entering the Third Dimension</h2>
            <p>The core of our project is 3D localization. We began rendering buildings and structures in 3D, allowing for vertical tracking—crucial for multi-story operations.</p>

            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="phase3">
            <h2>Phase 3: Building the UI and Agents</h2>
            <p>With the 3D world established, we focused on the interface. We introduced firefighter icons and a dashboard displaying critical data such as BPM and status, visualizing the agents within the system.</p>

            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="phase4">
            <h2>Phase 4: Tracking Movement</h2>
            <p>Static points are useful, but movement tells a story. We implemented trajectory tracking to visualize the path taken by agents over time.</p>

            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="phase5">
            <h2>Phase 5: Polishing the Experience</h2>
            <p>As we neared completion, we focused on the user interface, ensuring that critical information is easily accessible without cluttering the view.</p>

            <h2>Under the Hood</h2>
            <p>Our system is built on a robust architecture designed for reliability and speed. Here's a look at how the components interact.</p>
